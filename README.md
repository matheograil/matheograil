<p align="left">Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Math√©o and I'm currently a full-stack developer based in Lyon, France. While I'm still a student (Epitech), I'm building with some good friends Qiton, a new platform that allows esports professional teams to get all available statistics in one place. We are focusing our work on Valorant for now. We have the incredible opportunity to work with G2 Esports. They provide us advices to make Qiton better!<br><br>You can take a look at [https://qiton.app](qiton.app).</p>
